# Output: acs(clean).csv, which will serve as 'testing' data, and cps(clean).csv, which will serve as 'training' data.

# Note: Make sure you are in an R PROJECT - that will set your working directory
#       from there you can use short, relative paths
# Note: See https://censusreporter.org for a listing of ACS tables. For a tutorial on the 
# acs package, see https://rpubs.com/rosenblum_jeff/censustutorial1. The CPS data was
