# Data Analytics Capstone

We will be using Github as our primary medium for course materials. You will use Github to
1. Turn in reading assignments. See "Reading Assignment" folder for the actual reading assignment. 
Turn in your responses by simply writing your answer within the .Rmd files I've started for you and compiling to pdf. (These files contain the questions.)
2. Keep me in the loop on your coding progress. Make sure to push (and pull) regularly! This will serve as a part of your progress reports outside of your verbal presentation. 

See our syllabus for more details.
